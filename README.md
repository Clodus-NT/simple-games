# Simple Games (React)

## Purpose:
I built this website with the goal of practicing and gaining a better understanding of React hooks. Styling is minimal as the purpose is not to make the most pleasing site to the eyes, but rather to gain experience.

## Contents:
There are seven simple games included:
* Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Memory Match
* Whac-A-Mole
* Breakout
* Frogger
* Connect Four
* Space Invaders
